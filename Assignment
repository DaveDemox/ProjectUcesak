     * listByFaceshapeCategoryId(faceshapeCategoryId) - Lists hairstyles by faceshape category

4. Describe API endpoints (commands)
   Status: ✅ Completed
   - Category Endpoints:
     * GET /api/categories - List all categories
     * GET /api/categories/:id - Get specific category

   - Each endpoint includes:
     * Input/Output schemas
     * Validation rules
     * Error handling
     * Business logic

5. Create git repository and initialize project
   Status: ✅ Completed
   - Project initialized with npm
   - Basic structure created
   - Dependencies installed:
     * express

7. Push changes to git repository
   Status: ✅ Completed
   - Git repository initialized
   - .gitignore created
   - Initial commit made
   - Repository pushed to GitHub
   - URL: https://github.com/DaveDemox/ProjectUcesak

Next Steps:
1. Create schema diagram
2. Add testing
3. Add more detailed documentation
4. Consider adding:
   * Input validation middleware
   * Logging system
   * Rate limiting
   * API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
